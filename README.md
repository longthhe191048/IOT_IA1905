## üìå Project Summary

This remote health monitoring system is designed to collect vital signs such as body temperature and heart rate using biomedical sensors. Data is displayed on an LCD screen and a web/app interface, allowing doctors to monitor and provide feedback remotely. All data is stored in real time in a cloud database and can be exported as Excel sheets for analysis and reporting.

The project supports remote healthcare, especially in regions with limited medical staff or during pandemics.

## I. Project Introduction

### I.1. Motivation

There is a growing demand for remote health monitoring, especially in pandemics or areas with medical staff shortages. Vital signs such as heart rate and body temperature need to be monitored continuously. Automation and remote data access can ease the burden on the healthcare system.

### I.2. Project Overview

- Measures heart rate and temperature using sensors
- Displays data on LCD and Web/App
- Enables doctors to monitor remotely
